Welcome back. We were discussing Scala control structures.
The last item among the control abstraction is the for expression.
The Scala's for loop is a swiss army knife of iterations.
Here is the general structure of the for expression.

// for ( seq ) yield { expr }

It looks simple, but I realized that it is quite confusing to explain the above structure.
Let me take a progressive approach to explain that. To simplify the structure,
 let's ignore the yield for now. The yield is optional.
  You will be using it most of the time, but let's keep it aside for the moment.
Now the structure looks like this.

for ( seq ) { expr }





Let's try to understand this structure.If you learned other languages,
the above structure should look familiar.
The things inside the parenthesis will control the number of iterations,
and those curly braces represent the body of the loop. That's how it is in most of the languages.

for (i <- 1 to 10) {
  statement - 1;
  statement - 2;
}


You can have one or more expressions within the body.
If you have a single expression, curly braces are optional.
 We don't have any complexity for the body of the loop. It is almost same as any other language.
But the seq is somewhat complicated. It keeps confusing a lot of people.

The sequence generator in Scala for loop
Letâ€™s start with the simplest form of the seq and then expand it step by step.
The simplest form of seq is a generator that looks something like below.

e <- col

The col is a Scala collection, and e is a value that binds to each element of the collection.
Let's take an example.

val seq = 1 to 5
// seq is a Range collection with ten elements.
//Now I can iterate through this collection using a for Loop.
for (i <- seq) println(i)
// You can remove the middleman and get a collection on the fly.
for (i <- 1 to 5) println(i)
 */
// or we can write this
  val seq= List("India", "USA", "China", "Japan")

  for{
     element <-seq

  } println(element)
  // or we can use partial function inside the body of for comprehension
  val result =for (country <- List("India", "USA", "China", "Japan"))  {
    country match {
      case "India" => println("Delhi")
      case "USA"   => println("Washington D.C.")
      case "Japan" => println("Tokyo")
      case _       => println("I don't know")
    }
  }
  // or
  for(element <-seq)  element match {
    case "India" => println("Delhi")
    case "USA"   => println("Washington D.C.")
    case "Japan" => println("Tokyo")
    case _       => println("I don't know")
  }



  /*
  The Scala for loop is just a syntactic sugar for Higher Order Control Abstractions.
  Internally, both are same. What does it mean?
That means the Scala compiler will convert the for loop to a combination of following control abstractions.

foreach
map
flatMap
withFilter


In other words, Scala doesn't have a for loop.
It's just a syntactic sugar for a set of these methods. So,
if you don't like the for loop, you can manage to code in Scala without even worrying about the for loops.
 The real purpose of the Scala for expression is to write the code in a way that makes more sense.
  You should use the for expression when you think your code is getting
too cryptic using these methods and it would make more sense if you implement it using a for expression.

The Yield in Scala for expression
Now let's bring the yield back into the structure.

for ( seq ) yield { expr }
in the absence of yield for comprehension behaves like forEach control abstraction
because forEach returns the unit where as when yield comes it becomes like
we applying map function after each iteration
IT WILL be like seq.flatmap(s => _).map
   */


  val result1: Seq[Unit] =for (country <- List("India", "USA", "China", "Japan")) yield {
    country match {
      case "India" => println("Delhi")
      case "USA"   => println("Washington D.C.")
      case "Japan" => println("Tokyo")
      case _       => println("I don't know")
    }
  }

// here As we can see yield  is working as we are applying the map function to each single element
  // of Seq and transforming that into another Seq[Any]
  // specility of yield is that it will return a value for those pattren which are not matched also
    // we say some default values will be returned

  val result2: Seq[String] =for (country <- List("India", "USA", "China", "Japan")) yield {
    country match {
      case "India" => "Delhi"
      case "USA"   => "Washington D.C."
      case "Japan" => "Tokyo"
      case _       => "I don't know"
    }
  }
println(result2)

  // more examples of for comprehension
  val dataSeq = Source.fromFile("C:\\prem\\prem\\Data\\Spark_VM\\emp.txt").getLines().toList
  for(line <- dataSeq){
    val fields = line.split(",")
    println(fields.apply(0) + "----"+ fields.apply(1)+ "----"+ fields.apply(2))
  }
  //Lets put assignment inside the For not in the body this is more clean code
  // make body as simple as possible

  for{
    line <- dataSeq
     fields = line.split(",")
  }  println(fields.apply(0) + "----"+ fields.apply(1)+ "----"+ fields.apply(2))

// applying if filter inside for
  /*
  In crux For Comprehension has three components
   A generator
   B Filter
   C a defination or assignment
   like this in the
   line <- dataSeq
     fields = line.split(",")

  for{
    line <- dataSeq // generateor
    fields = line.split(",") // assignent
    if(fields.apply(2).equals("SALESMAN")) // if filter
  } println(fields.apply(0) + "----"+ fields.apply(1)+ "----"+ fields.apply(2))
//
